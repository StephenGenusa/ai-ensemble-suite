## Quick Start

You will want to determine which GGUF models you wish to work with. Download them and place in the root folder of the project under a /models directory... or change the YAML to point to the location of your models.

Here's a minimal example to get started with AI Ensemble Suite:

```python
from ai_ensemble_suite import Ensemble

# Initialize the ensemble with a configuration
ensemble = Ensemble(config_path="path/to/config.yaml")

# Initialize models (loads them into memory)
await ensemble.initialize()

# Ask a question
try:
    response = await ensemble.ask("What are the key considerations for sustainable urban planning?")
    print(response)
finally:
    # Release resources when done
    await ensemble.shutdown()

# Alternatively, use with async context manager
async with Ensemble(config_path="path/to/config.yaml") as ensemble:
    response = await ensemble.ask("What are the key considerations for sustainable urban planning?")
    print(response)
```

## AI Ensembles Explained

Think of AI ensembles like getting advice from a group of experts instead of just one person. Just as you might ask several friends for opinions before making an important decision, AI ensembles combine the strengths of multiple AI systems or approaches to produce better results than any single AI could achieve alone. Instead of relying on one AI that might have blind spots or make certain types of mistakes, ensembles bring together diverse AI perspectives that can check each other's work, complement each other's strengths, and collectively arrive at more reliable answers. It's similar to how a team of doctors with different specialties might collaborate on a difficult medical case—the combined expertise leads to better outcomes than what any individual doctor could provide on their own.

**Brief Explanations of AI Ensemble Techniques**

* **AsyncThinking**: Like a rapid brainstorming session where multiple people jot down ideas independently before sharing, this technique generates diverse initial thoughts quickly without influence from other perspectives.

* **StructuredCritique**: Similar to having your work reviewed by a tough but fair editor, this approach systematically evaluates ideas, identifies logical flaws, and improves the rigor of thinking.

* **SynthesisOriented**: Acts like a skilled mediator who finds common ground between opposing viewpoints, integrating different perspectives into a balanced, comprehensive analysis.

* **RoleBasedDebate**: Resembles a panel discussion with experts from different fields, each contributing specialized knowledge to address complex topics from multiple angles.

* **HierarchicalReview**: Works like a multi-stage editing process, where content is refined layer by layer, with each review focusing on different aspects for progressive improvement.

* **CompetitiveEvaluation**: Functions like a contest where multiple solutions compete, and the strongest approach wins based on objective criteria.

* **PerspectiveRotation**: Similar to walking around a sculpture to view it from all sides, this technique examines issues from different stakeholder perspectives, ethical frameworks, or creative angles.

* **ChainOfThoughtBranching**: Like mapping out a complex maze with multiple possible paths, this method explores different reasoning routes for problems with multiple decision points.

* **AdversarialImprovement**: Acts as a stress-test or devil's advocate, actively looking for weaknesses in a solution to strengthen it against potential problems.

* **RoleBasedWorkflow**: Operates like a production line with specialized stations, creating a structured process where different roles handle specific aspects of a multi-stage analysis.

* **Bagging**: Works like taking the average of multiple poll results to get a more stable prediction, reducing the impact of outliers or unusual patterns.

* **UncertaintyBasedCollaboration**: Similar to how a group might work together on a puzzle with missing pieces, this approach handles ambiguous questions by combining different levels of confidence.

* **StackedGeneralization**: Functions like a team of specialists with a coordinator, where outputs from different AI models are combined to leverage their unique strengths and minimize weaknesses.

## Why Ensembles Work

Ensemble methods have a strong theoretical and empirical foundation in machine learning, and they're particularly effective with language models for several reasons:

1. **Diverse Knowledge and Perspectives**: Different language models, even when trained on similar data, develop slightly different internal representations and "expertise areas." By combining multiple models, you access a broader knowledge base than any single model contains.

2. **Error Reduction Through Aggregation**: Models tend to make different errors. When their outputs are combined intelligently, errors from one model can be corrected by others, leading to more accurate results.

3. **Specialization Through Roles**: When models adopt specialized roles (like critic, researcher, or synthesizer), they can focus on specific aspects of a task. This division of cognitive labor mirrors effective human teams and leads to more thorough analysis.

4. **Iterative Refinement**: Multi-step collaboration allows initial ideas to be critiqued, refined, and expanded. This resembles human drafting and editing processes, typically producing higher quality results than single-pass generation.

5. **Confidence Calibration**: Ensemble techniques help identify areas of uncertainty or disagreement between models, leading to better-calibrated confidence in the final output.

Research consistently shows that properly designed ensembles outperform even the strongest individual models, often by significant margins. AI Ensemble Suite provides the infrastructure to easily tap into these powerful techniques.

## Why This Library?

AI Ensemble Suite was created to address two key challenges:

1. **The Need for Human-Friendly Ensemble AI**: After extensive searching for a comprehensive yet easy-to-use library for ensemble AI work that followed a "for humans" philosophy, nothing quite fit the bill. This library makes it easy to harness multiple smaller language models on local machines to produce enhanced AI responses.

2. **Structured Collaboration Patterns**: Rather than just averaging model outputs, AI Ensemble Suite implements sophisticated collaboration patterns where models can critique, refine, and extend each other's work - resulting in higher quality responses that benefit from diverse model strengths.

The framework is designed with simplicity in mind for common use cases while providing comprehensive customization for advanced users.

Additionally, this project served as a meta-challenge to build a medium sized Python library using AI assistance despite context window limitations, developing techniques to work around these constraints.

## Examples

The library includes several example scripts demonstrating different ensemble techniques:

- **Basic Usage**: Non-ensembled simple usage with default configurations
- **Structured Debate**: Models present opposing viewpoints to refine conclusion
- **Expert Committee**: Specialized models contribute domain expertise
- **Hierarchical Review**: Progressive refinement through layers of specialized models
- **Competitive Evaluation**: Multiple solutions generated and evaluated against criteria
- **Perspective Rotation**: Problem analyzed through different framing lenses
- **Chain-of-Thought Branching**: Reasoning paths that branch and reconverge
- **Adversarial Improvement**: One model finds flaws in another's reasoning
- **Role-based Workflow**: Models adopt complementary roles in a structured process
- **Bagging**: Combines models to reduce prediction variance

> **Note on Examples**: Some example files require additional libraries not included in requirements.txt. Several examples also generate graphic charts to disk, which were implemented to help visualize how the ensemble builds the final result. These visualization features are optional but helpful for testing and understanding the process.

## API Reference

### Core Classes

#### Ensemble

```python
class Ensemble:
    """Coordinates the collaboration of multiple AI models for complex tasks."""
    
    def __init__(self, config_path: Optional[str] = None, config_dict: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> None:
        """Initialize the Ensemble orchestration layer."""
        
    async def initialize(self) -> None:
        """Load models and prepare the ensemble for processing queries."""
        
    async def shutdown(self) -> None:
        """Release resources used by the ensemble."""
        
    async def ask(self, query: str, **kwargs: Any) -> Union[str, Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Process a query through the configured collaboration and aggregation pipeline."""
        
    def configure(self, config_dict: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        """Update the ensemble's configuration dynamically."""
```

#### ModelManager

```python
class ModelManager:
    """Manages the loading, execution, and lifecycle of GGUF models."""
    
    def __init__(self, config_manager: ConfigProvider, max_workers: Optional[int] = None) -> None:
        """Initialize the ModelManager."""
        
    async def initialize(self) -> None:
        """Initialize the ModelManager: Instantiates models and loads them asynchronously."""
        
    async def shutdown(self) -> None:
        """Shutdown the ModelManager: Unloads models and shuts down the executor."""
        
    async def run_inference(self, model_id: str, prompt: str, **kwargs: Any) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Run inference on a specific model using its generate method via thread pool."""
```

#### BaseCollaborationPhase

```python
class BaseCollaborationPhase(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for collaboration phases."""
    
    def __init__(self, model_manager: "ModelManager", config_manager: "ConfigManager", phase_name: str) -> None:
        """Initialize the collaboration phase."""
        
    @abstractmethod
    async def execute(self, query: str, context: Dict[str, Any], trace_collector: Optional[TraceCollector] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Execute the collaboration phase."""
```

#### BaseAggregator

```python
class BaseAggregator(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for aggregation strategies."""
    
    def __init__(self, config_manager: "ConfigManager", strategy_name: str, model_manager: Optional["ModelManager"] = None, strategy_config_override: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> None:
        """Initialize the aggregator."""
        
    @abstractmethod
    async def aggregate(self, outputs: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]], context: Dict[str, Any], trace_collector: Optional[TraceCollector] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Aggregate the outputs from collaboration phases."""
```

## Running Tests

### 👉 Note: Tests are currently broken. They were originally developed early on in the development process and are now out of date. I will be updating these later.
 
```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=ai_ensemble_suite
```

## Roadmap

- Refinement and cleanup of the current codebase
- Rewriting the existing tests due to API changes from early code
- Adding OpenAI API compatibility for local LLM servers like LM Studio, Ollama
- Support for Internet API providers
